        <h3 class="headline3 spacer-4--bottom">Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>We partnered with the University of Chicago’s Center for Decision Research (CDR) with the goal to increase both the number and diversity of visitors to their new discovery center in downtown Chicago. The center will feature interactive exhibits to help inform the general public about the importance of behavioral science and how they can leverage behavioral science to make better life decisions. In addition, CDR is a research hub, which aims to encourage visitors to participate in scientific research studies.</p>
        <p>We conducted primary and secondary research where we learned what motivates individuals to visit museums, whether they explore alone or in a group, and possible deterrents to their future visits. As a result we identified patterns in the form of archetypes, which led us to solutions that increase both the number and diversity of visitors to CDR.</p>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h3 class="headline3 spacer-4--bottom">Focus and Scope</h3>
        <p> To get started with our process, we first used the 5E framework as a model for us to define the scope of our project. Our group's main focus was the Entice and Extend part of the visitor experience, highlighted in yellow.</p>

        <h3 class="headline3 spacer-4--bottom">Goals &amp; Questions</h3>
        <p>Our primary goal was to gain a better understanding of the intended audience for CDR. Specifically we aimed to:</p>
        <ul class="list spacer-4--bottom">
          <li>
            <p>Understand the CDR team's current goals, plans and research regarding the intended audience</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Understand what drives people to visit learner-focused spaces such as museums</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Discover the factors that lead visitors to believe their experience was valuable</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>From these goals we drafted a series of research questions to guide our process:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <p>How might we encourage the general public to visit the CDR experience?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What are the diverse and salient motivations, goals and attitudes that determine how and why members of the public would be compelled to visit the CDR experience?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How might we inspire exhibit visitors and study participants to continue to feel a connection with the CDR experience after their visit has been completed?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="spacer-5--bottom">
          <h4 class="headline4 spacer-3--bottom">Stakeholder &amp; Expert Interviews</h4>
          <p>To kick off the project, we sought to understand previous research, plans and stakeholders’ goals for CDR. In order to do so, we conducted a virtual workshop with CDR staff. We also conducted an expert interview with a museum exhibit designer (AJ Goehle, CEO of Luci Creative) in order to understand how the industry approaches audience research and definition. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer-5--bottom">
          <h4 class="headline4 spacer-3--bottom">Audience Interviews</h4>
          <p>We conducted virtual interviews to understand what drives people to visit exhibits similar to CDR and to validate previous marketing research. We recruited 15 participants through convenience sampling. We aimed to reach participants who were not primarily undergraduate or graduate college students. During the interviews, we asked them what caused them to visit the venue, what they did while they were there, and whether they shared their experiences post-visit. After the interviews, we synthesized salient points from our transcripts and notes into an affinity diagram to develop major themes.

          <h4 class="headline4 spacer-3--bottom">Audience Survey</h4>
          <p>We conducted a quantitative survey to further prioritize and validate our findings from qualitative research. The survey featured 14 questions, and a total of 43 participants completed the survey.</p>

        <div class="spacer-5--bottom">
          <h4 class="headline4 spacer-3--bottom">Literature Review</h4>
          <p>To gain insight into how CDR may effectively define and activate audiences, we performed a literature review of nine sources covering the areas of museum studies, tourism, civic activation methods, and retail customer engagement. We learned that a critical predictor of the likelihood of making a visit and post-visit satisfaction is how closely the exhibit experience matches one of five temporary identity-based motivations: Explorer, Experience Seeker, Professional/Hobbyist, Facilitator, and Recharger. Because CDR is positioned in a heavily touristed location, we also reviewed research on the motivations behind a tourist’s choice of destination. While many tourist motivations categories overlapped with the museum visitors categories, an additional category emerged: Entertainment Seeker, which represents a non-learner based motivation.</p>
