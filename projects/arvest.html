        <h3 class="headline3 spacer-4--bottom">Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>Arvest Bank offers various services such as home loans, credit cards, and wealth management.  It is one of the 
          largest and oldest banks headquartered in Arkansas, with branches in Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.</p>
        <p>Poor page wayfinding can obstruct users from finding relevant products and/or deter users from visiting. 
          As a result, the main goal of the project was to evaluate the structure and organization of existing web pages 
          then provide solutions and a low-fidelity proposal on how to improve site navigation. </p>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h3 class="headline3 spacer-4--bottom">Personas</h3>
        <p>To kick off the project, my partner and I wanted the needs of our users represented in the new proposed design. 
          The purpose of this was to create realistic representations of the target audience and to empathize with the end user. </p>

        <div class="spacer-5--bottom">
        <h3 class="headline4 spacer-4--bottom">Content Inventory</h3>
        <p>I conducted a content inventory containing 611 items for the primary, secondary, and side navigation. 
          For the scope of this project, I didn’t inventory the nested navigation. </p> 
          <p> What I found:</p>
          <ul class="list spacer-5--bottom">
            <li>
              <p> <strong>Duplication</strong> of content items throughout their navigation. There were duplicate and similar pages throughout 
                their entire website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The website had <strong>broken workflows</strong>. Customers struggled to anticipate where they may find a specific item within the website.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="headline4 spacer-4--bottom">Card Sort</h3>
        <p>After conducting the content inventory, we met via Zoom to discuss how we may streamline the navigation. We worked together to 
          create a more efficient way to organize everything. After doing that, we conducted two digital hybrid card sorts to understand 
          how users envisioned the organization of information and how concepts were grouped together. </p> 
          <p>Participants were recruited through LinkedIn, Facebook, and convenience sampling.</p>
          <p>The first card sort had a total of eight participants that completed the test. Participants grouped thirty-one items under six 
            categories. We found inconsistencies in grouping of a few of the cards and a few participants created their “I don’t know what 
            this means” category. This informed us that the language being used was confusing. </p>
          <p>We went back to the drawing board to create an even more streamlined navigation system based on the results of the first card 
              sort. We renamed and deleted cards that users were not familiar with. </p>
          <p>The second card sort had twenty-four participants that completed the test. Participants grouped thirty items under six 
                categories. There was increased consistency in grouping of the cards. However, there was a range of results for the 
                “Auto Service Plans” card which we had renamed from “Auto Service Contracts.” Following a discussion of whether to remove 
                this card from the navigation, we decided against it because it is an important service offered by Arvest Bank.</p>
                <h3 class="headline4 spacer-4--bottom">Site Map</h3>
                <p>Based on the card sort results, we created a site map to visually represent the site’s organization and how different 
                  sections would be linked together. Doing this helped us identify where content should sit and showed the relationship 
                  between different pages. </p> 
                  <div class="image-container color-bg-cream spacer-5--top">
                  <img src="/static/images/arvest/sitemap.png">
                </div>
                <h3 class="headline4 spacer-4--bottom spacer-4--top">IA Testing</h3>
                <p>We conducted an IA test to see how easy or difficult it was for users to complete five tasks based on our proposed IA.  </p> 
                  <div class="image-container color-bg-cream spacer-5--top spacer-4--bottom">
                  <img src="/static/images/arvest/IAtesting.png">
                </div>
                <p> The results from the test gave us a clear understanding of how users were navigating the tasks. 4 out of 5 tasks had a 
                  100% success rate. Task 5 had a success rate of 67% which was a major point of concern for us so we delved deeper to 
                  understand why. </p>
                <p>Task 5 scenario was: “Imagine you have a family and want to make sure they are taken care of in case anything happened 
                  to you. Can you show me where you would go to learn more about that?” </p>
                <p>Two out of six participants selected “Accidental Death Insurance” instead of “Life Insurance.” The distinction between 
                  those two choices are small, but they offer different services, so it was necessary to keep both of them. </p>
                  <h3 class="headline4 spacer-4--bottom">Wireframes</h3>
                  <p>We used figma to draw the mid-fidelity wireframes. The purpose of this was to map out the functionality of the pages 
                    and catch any flow problems.  </p> 
                    <div class="image-container color-bg-cream spacer-5--top">
                    <img src="/static/images/arvest/wireframes.png">
                  </div>
                  <h3 class="headline4 spacer-4--bottom spacer-4--top">First-Click Test</h3>
                  <p>Armed with the wireframes, we conducted a first-click test to understand where on the interface users would click to 
                    complete a task. </p>
                  <p>There were a total of seven participants that completed the test. </p>
                  <p>The first key task was to create a checking account and there was a 100% success rate. All participants clicked 
                    the “Open Account” button on the homepage. </p>
                  <p>The second key task was to learn more about opening your first card. There was only a 58% success rate with 
                    his task. </p>
                    <ul class="list spacer-5--bottom">
                      <li>
                        <p>58% participants clicked the correct button which was “Compare Credit Cards.”</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>14% clicked the credit card image right above the button. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>14% clicked the label “Choose the right Arvest Credit Card for you.” </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Lastly, 14% clicked “Open Account,” which I labeled as an outlier. </p>
                      </li>
                  </p>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="separator">...</p>
      <div class="project-section">
        <h3 class="headline3 spacer-4--bottom">Future Steps</h3>
        <p>Due to time constraints, we were unable to create new iterations from our results. However, next steps would have been to do 
          that followed by another round of IA and usability tests on the proposed redesign.  </p>
